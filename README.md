# zucchinibread.js ü•íüçû

This is a distillation of some of the code I've been using to make games for the last little while. Code for loading/managing audio, loading/displaying images, running a very simple game loop, as well as a quite general and extensible 'screen transition' system. You could charitably call it a "game engine," but that might be giving it a little too much credit. I will probably add support for other stuff I like later (I'd like to add sprite registration points, tilemap drawing, objects that can update themselves, and clickable button UI stuff), but I'm trying to be conservative with what I move into the library in case I need to change behaviors later.

Sorry about the underscores.

## How do?

### setup

Create an `index.html` file to hold your game. Make sure it has a `<canvas>` element that has some ID. This is the canvas that will be used for drawing.

I recommend just dropping `zucchinibread.js` into your project folder and doing something like
```
<script src="zucchinibread.js"></script>
<script src="game.js"></script>
```

Now make a file `game.js` where you put your game logic.

Here is how to initialize your game:

```
let game;

zb.ready(function() {
    game = zb.create_game({
        /* Parameters to set up the game */
        canvas: 'mycanvas',          /* ID of your canvas element */
        canvas_w: 640,               /* Width of your drawing canvas */
        canvas_h: 480,               /* Height of your drawing canvas */
        draw_scale: 4,               /* How much the pixels should be scaled up. */
        background_color: '#000000', /* Background color that will be drawn underneath everything you draw */
        
        /* Functions that are called each frame to update/draw the game */
        draw_func: do_draw,          /* Function that will be called in the game loop to render the game */
        update_func: do_update,      /* Function that will be called to update the game state - 1 parameter, time delta of update in ms */

        /* Event handlers for the regular JS events */
        events: {
            mouseup: mouseup_func,
            keydown: keydown_func,
            /* etc. */
        },                          /* Callbacks for events. Receive the game object as 1st parameter, event 2nd. */

        /* Optional parameters you can add: */
        frame_rate: 60,              /* Frame rate the game will run at - optional, default 60 */
        run_in_background: true,     /* disable auto-pausing when clicking away from game (optional, default false) */
        save_key: 'example.game.hi', /* put this to enable saving; key where the save file will be stored in localStorage */
        
        /* You can also add any random extra global parameters you want to store here as well: */
        tile_size: 8,                /* How big each 'tile' in the game is. */
        level_w: 20,                 /* Width of the game levels. */
        level_h: 14,                 /* Height of the game levels. */

    });

    /* CALL THE OTHER REGISTER FUNCTIONS (EXPLAINED BELOW) HERE IF YOU HAVE THEM */

    game.resources_ready();

    /* Do any other initialization you need to here. */
});
```

Oh no global state!! Well, it's a video game. ;)

Make sure you call `resources_ready()` after you register all your resources, or the game will never finish loading. It's like a safety feature, to let the game know you're done telling it to load new stuff.

Also, make sure to provide three images in the root folder: `loading.png`, `clicktostart.png`, and `pause.png`, which will be drawn over the full screen (a) when the game is loading; (b) when it has finished loading and should be clicked to start; (c) when you click out of the game and it pauses. (`pause.png` is optional if `run_in_background` is enabled)

### resource loading

Here are the things the engine knows how to do, which you should load in the `ready` function after creating the game object:

#### sound effects

```
game.register_sfx({
    sfx1: {
        path: 'sfx/sfx1.wav',
        volume: 0.05,
    },
    sfx2: {
        path: 'sfx/sfx2.wav',
        volume: 0.05,
    },
    /* etc. */
});
```

This loads a few copies of each sound effect into an array so they can be played over each other properly.

You can play the sound effects later with `game.sfx.sfx1.play()`.

#### images

```
game.register_images({
    tiles: 'tile.png',
    character: 'character.png',
    objs: 'objs.png',
    enemies: {
        bean: 'enemies/bean.png',
        clock: 'enemies/clock.png',
        noodle: 'enemies/noodle.png',
    }
});
```

This will cause the game to go and find these images and load them in for you. You can access them later at `game.img.tiles` or whatever. As you can see here, you can also provide a more complex nested series of paths, and it will handle them correctly (in this example the enemy image objects will be accessible at `game.img.enemies.bean`, etc.)

#### music

```
game.register_music({
    bgm1: {
        path: 'music/bgm1',
        volume: 0.5,
    }
    bgm2: {
        path: 'music/bgm2',
        volume: 0.5,
    },
});
```

This will pull the proper music files. Note that if you do not specify a file extension, it will add either `.mp3` or `.ogg` depending on what is supported by your browser. (if you don't want to do both, it defaults to mp3 and I think most browsers nowadays support mp3? Firefox didn't used to I'm pretty sure.) Or you can just give the file extension like a normal person. Anyway, these are just normal `audio` objects, except that they automatically pause when you click out of the game if `run_in_background` is set to false.

Also, you can mute the game's sound with `game.mute()`, unmute with `game.unmute()`, or toggle mute with `game.toggle_mute()`.

### If you please, draw me a sheep

You can draw stuff in a few different ways. The `draw` function gets passed the 'drawing canvas', which is a normal HTML canvas 2D context which gets scaled up by a factor of `draw_scale` and then drawn to your original canvas. You can draw shapes or images with the [normal HTML canvas drawing functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial). Additionally, the library provides a few convenience functions to draw images or parts of images:

* `zb.screen_draw(context, image)`: Draws an image over the whole screen. Actually it just draws the image at (0, 0). Since this engine doesn't really have text support, this is usually how I handle drawing text for each level -- just make a big image that's the size of the screen and put text wherever you want. As a bonus, you can draw images and stuff into it as well! Wow so flexible!
* `zb.sprite_draw(context, image, section_w, section_h, section_x, section_y, dest_x, dest_y)`: This one divides up the source image into chunks of size `section_w` x `section_h`, then takes the chunk at grid location (`section_x`, `section_y`) and draws it to the screen at coordinates (`dest_x`, `dest_y`). Useful for drawing tilemaps and/or sprite animations!

Each of these takes the drawing context as the first argument and the image as the second argument.

### Save load

If you specified a `save_key` when creating your game, you have save/load functionality.

If the user has third party cookies disabled in chrome, this will block saving. So you will need to provide another full-screen image in the root folder, `saveerror.png`, which will be shown before the game starts and should warn the user about the fact that their game will not be able to save.

You also get access to these two functions:
* `game.save(key, data)`: Saves the data `data` under the key `key`. Pretty self-explanatory. It saves using `JSON.stringify`, so make sure to only ... save ... stuff that can be stringified?? Sure
* `game.load(key)`: Returns the data that was previously saved under `key`, or `undefined` if nothing was saved there.

These functions silently fail if saving does not work due to having cookies disabled. I should probably add a way to tell if saving is broken... :/

### random extra utility functions

Currently there is only one of these.

* `zb.mod(number, modulo)`: This takes the number `number` and gives you the result of `number` modulo `modulo`. It works the same as the normal Javascript `%` operator, except that the output is always guaranteed to be within the range [0, `modulo`), which isn't true of regular `%` when the first value is negative. Since the default `%` behavior is basically something I've never wanted ever, this is a convenience function that does the correct thing instead.

### mapcompile.py

`levels/mapcompile.py` is a Python script. It compiles levels created with [Tiled](https://mapeditor.org) into a very particular and stupid format. Sometimes I make changes to this script when the levels have objects or whatever in them as well, and it adds that data in too. Requires the [ulvl](https://ulvl.github.io/) library, and should be run like so:

```
levels/mapcompile.py levels/*.tmx > levels.js
```

If you want to do your levels differently, feel free. I mean I'm not your mom.
