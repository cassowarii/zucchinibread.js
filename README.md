zucchinibread.js
================

This is a distillation of some of the code I've been using to make puzzle games for the last little while. Code for loading/managing audio, loading/displaying images, running a very simple game loop, as well as a quite general and extensible 'screen transition' system. You could charitably call it a "game engine," but that might be giving it a little too much credit. I will probably add support for other stuff I like later (like spritesheets and map drawing), but I'm trying to be conservative with what I move into the library in case I need to change behaviors later.
